0,"A nine-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly raped and murdered by a priest and his accomplices at a crematorium near Delhi cantonment on August 1 died due to “suffocation” during the sexual assault, the Delhi Police have told a city court ,citing disclosure statements of two accused in the case.Quoting the disclosure statement of one of the accused, the police said in a document submitted in court -- parts of it were seen by HT -- that priest Radhey Shyam put his hand on the mouth of the minor victim while sexually assaulting her following which she couldn’t breathe and died due to “suffocation”. Kuldeep Singh allegedly held the victim’s hand while she was being assaulted by Shyam.
 
 This is the first time the girl’s cause of death has come to light, and it appears to debunk the claims made by the accused. The accused, 55-year-old Shyam and his three associates, Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmed and Laxmi Narayan, have maintained that the girl died of electrocution while fetching water from a cooler. The girl’s family alleged that the suspects hurriedly cremated the body after raping her.","['year', 'crematorium', 'laxmi narayan', 'sexual assault', 'disclosure statement', 'girl', 'parts', 'old dalit girl', 'disclosure statements', 'victim', 'claims', 'electrocution', 'shyam', 'city court', 'first time', 'priest', 'document', 'associates', 'salim ahmed', 'delhi police', 'water', 'suspects', 'minor victim', 'family', 'court', 'death', 'august', 'police', 'old shyam', 'cause', 'ht', 'case', 'delhi', 'cooler', 'body', 'accomplices', 'suffocation', 'hand', 'light', 'mouth', 'priest radhey shyam', 'kuldeep singh']","Delhi, Delhi Cantonment",28.61767496,77.15120691,11:00:00,08-01-2021,Rape

6,"Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti violence: Important lessons to be drawn from these ugly riots
No fewer than a dozen incidents of extreme communal violence leading to disruption of normal life, vandalism, arson and looting were witnessed in 10 states. Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti are, comparatively, peaceful festivals, but this year was unusual and exceptional. It saw no fewer than a dozen incidents of extreme communal violence leading to disruption of normal life, vandalism, arson and looting across 10 states, including Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and Goa. Surprisingly, a very communally sensitive state like Uttar Pradesh did not witness a single communal incident during this period.

The rioting, it seems, had a set pattern. Processions moved around with and without permission from authorities, resulting in severe brick-batting, ugly confrontation and a free for all as it happened at Karauli in Rajasthan and Khargone in Madhya Pradesh.

As for Delhi, it saw a repetition of communal violence after 2020. In Jahangirpuri, three processions were taken out: Two reportedly with police permission, and one without any permission, with a bizarre claim that the organisers had applied for permission but did not get any response from the police. They presumed that the permission had been granted (implied consent) and the procession was taken out, which led to serious incidents of rioting. Many vehicles were set on fire, a police sub-inspector was assaulted and sustained serious gunshot injuries, and two dozen people were arrested on the spot.

It was not just Jahangirpuri that saw these ugly incidents. The Jawaharlal Nehru University too witnessed unseemly clashes in the Kaveri Hostel where Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad students clashed with the students of Leftist ideology on something as trivial as the consumption of non-vegetarian food.","['vandalism', 'repetition', 'maharashtra', 'ugly riots', 'police', 'serious incidents', 'non - vegetarian food', 'goa', 'communal violence', 'dozen people', 'spot', 'uttar pradesh', 'police sub - inspector', 'police permission', 'ram navami', 'karauli', 'dozen incidents', 'rajasthan', 'single communal incident', 'hanuman jayanti', 'procession', 'unseemly clashes', 'khargone', 'something', 'arson', 'ugly confrontation', 'consent', 'many vehicles', 'students', 'madhya pradesh', 'states', 'permission', 'fire', 'severe brick', 'jharkhand', 'year', 'important lessons', 'kaveri hostel', 'disruption', 'period', 'delhi', 'bizarre claim', 'peaceful festivals', 'processions', 'batting', 'response', 'set pattern', 'gujarat', 'karnataka', 'leftist ideology', 'consumption', 'ugly incidents', 'hanuman jayanti violence', 'normal life', 'uttarakhand', 'serious gunshot injuries', 'rioting', 'authorities', 'sensitive state', 'extreme communal violence', 'looting', 'andhra pradesh', 'jahangirpuri', 'organisers', 'jawaharlal nehru university', 'akhil bharatiya vidyarthi', 'west bengal']",Jahangiripur,28.72936217,77.16747399,18:52:28,02-05-2022,Riot

valuables, he added. “They took Rs 25,000 from the cash box
and fired at the victim. A bullet pierced his jaw and he was
taken to hospital. He is stable after surgery,” the DCP said.
Following the incident, three teams were formed, one of
them led by inspector (special staff) Naveen Kumar. The
team scanned more than 50 cameras and spotted the
accused in footage. “We followed the CCTV trail. Finally, two and a half hours after the incident, both the accused were
tracked,” the officer said.
Cops found the two youths had gone up to the roof of a
building. Around 2:40pm, when police approached to catch
them, one of the accused fired a round from his countrymade pistol. The police team retaliated and fired two rounds.
One youth was hit on his leg and taken to hospital.

Relatives of Ikhlaq Salmani had claimed that his hand was chopped by some local men in Panipat allegedly after they saw a religious tattoo '786' on his hand.He had travelled to Panipat to look for a job in September 2020.The police had registered a First Information Report or FIR on Ikhlaq's complaint.However, a second FIR was filed on the same day by the men who allegedly attacked Ikhlaq, accusing him of ""sodomising"" a young boy in their family in August and claiming that he hurt himself when he fell on railway tracks nearby while he was fleeing.The court has acquitted Ikhlaq of the charges against him under the strict law involving child sex abuse and has raised doubts about the prosecution's account.
It noted that the sexual assault charges had not been ""corroborated by any medical evidence, which runs rather contrary to the assertions made by the victim"".
""This court is of the view that because of the inconsistencies, contradictions and the improbabilities in the testimonies of the victim, his father and uncle (complainant), the presumptions have been rebutted. Consequently, it is held that the testimony of the victim, his father and uncle is not sufficient and cannot become the sole basis to convict the accused,"" it said.
It also questioned the delay in filing the complaint about the alleged sexual assault - which the accusers had tried to explain by saying ""they were searching themselves for the accused"".""Complainant has himself stated in his complaint that the accused disclosed his name and address to him before fleeing from the spot. Why they did not immediately report the matter to the police and what is need to search for the accused on their own part?"" the court asked.

Sources said Afzal Ansari, one of the suspects, knew the boy, Mayank Thakur, and he roped in a friend, Imran Shaikh, to commit the crime. On July 30, Ansari asked Mayank to meet him saying he would give him a new mobile phone. Earlier, the boy had told him that he only had a SIM card. Ansari asked him to carry it. 

Ansari, a hairstylist, and Shaikh took Mayank to a green patch at Waliv in Vasai on the promise that he would be given the new mobile there. They strangulated him and stabbed him, dumped the body and took his SIM card, said the source. When her son didn’t return home in the evening, the mother filed a missing complaint with the Kashimira police.

Soon after the police registered the case, Ansari, 26, used the boy’s chip on his phone to call his mother and demand Rs 25 lakh from her. After being alerted by the mother, the police converted the missing case into kidnapping.

“The suspects thought the boy’s mother is a singer so she must be having a lot of money. The two said they would not have killed the boy had they got a place to keep him. To give the impression that Mayank was with them, they used his SIM card to make the ransom call,” said the source.

The accused had tied up the victim's colleague with belts and raped her.

216,"Grover visited Susairaj's Malad apartment Dhiraj Solitaire at 22:00 on 6 May to help her settle in. At the same time, Mathew called her up and got upset to hear a male voice in background. When Susairaj told Mathew that Grover had come over to help her, Jerome asked Maria not to allow Neeraj to stay overnight. Mathew at that time was living in Kochi. However, he took a flight and came to Mumbai the next day without telling Susairaj. He reached her apartment at 07:30. Susairaj opened the door and Mathew went straight into the bedroom to find Grover in the room. As per media and police reports, the two men had argument and then engaged in a physical fight. Mathew grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Grover, who died on the spot.

On 25 May, the crime branch recovered a nine-inch knife from Susairaj's apartment complex. Police believed that the knife was used to kill Grover.

Around 11:00 am the same day, Susairaj went to a nearby mall and purchased bags, air freshener, curtains, bed sheets & knife. She later told police that she did this on Jerome's instructions.

They both then took the dead body to the kitchen and chopped it into several pieces, stuffing them into the bags Susairaj had earlier bought. While many media outlets reported that Grover's body had been chopped into 300 pieces, the judge in the case would later state that this was ""...far from the facts on record"", and that such a description had caused ""confusion"" and had ""outraged the general public"".

217,"A little girl saved her mother from big trouble. When a history-sheeter entered their Mulund house to rape her mother, the four-year-old kept her wits about her, escaped and raised an alarm just in time for the locals to converge on their house and avert a sexual assault.


According to police officials, on Monday morning, 29-year-old Sarvant Jaypal, who is accused in several cases of assault and possession of firearms, entered the woman’s house. Cops said Jaypal had seen her husband at a tea stall close by and, taking advantage of his absence at home, crept in to attack his wife.


Speaking to mid-day, the woman’s husband said, “Jaypal, a local goon, saw that I was out getting tea and decided to attack my wife. After sneaking into our house, he locked the doors and pointed a knife at her stomach, ordering her to take off her maxi.”

She begged him not to rape her in front of her two children, but disregarding her pleas, he started undressing her. “It was 7 am and our two daughters, four and one, were sleeping. The elder one awoke when she heard my wife’s cries, but pretended to be asleep, until she spotted a chance to bolt out the door and call for help. She succeeded, and shortly the locals gathered and hauled Jaypal to the police station.”

One of the couple’s neighbours said, “The child came to me asking for help, after which I gathered a few residents and rushed to her house, where Jaypal was holding the woman at knifepoint.” While the accused was being handed over to the police, he apparently threatened to kill the woman. Fearing for her life, her husband has now sent her to live with her kin.

Residents of Vijay Nagar are reportedly afraid of Jaypal, who they say has attacked many of them and harassed several women in the past. “He roams around carrying a knife in his pocket and harassing girls in the area. He has no fear of being arrested again,” said a local.

The investigating officer, Sub-inspector Rupali Patode from Mulund police station, said, “We have arrested the accused, and learnt that he had also been arrested a year ago under the Arms Act. The incident took place at 7 am on Monday, and the complainants reported to the police station at around 10 am, after which a case was registered.”

Jaypal has been booked under section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code, and remanded in police custody for three days.","['old sarvant jaypal', 'sub - inspector rupali patode', 'stomach', 'intent', 'sexual assault', 'alarm', 'preparation', 'incident', 'jaypal', 'mother', 'chance', 'modesty', 'police officials', 'child', 'pleas', 'few residents', 'residents', 'monday', 'trespass', 'mulund police station', 'children', 'big trouble', 'possession', 'complainants', 'arms act', 'couple', 'sheeter', 'kin', 'several cases', 'doors', 'help', 'neighbours', 'assault', 'life', 'vijay nagar', 'knifepoint', 'pocket', 'wrongful restraint', 'days', 'past', 'area', 'police custody', 'local goon', 'girls', 'section', 'mulund house', 'year', 'wife', 'place', 'front', 'fear', 'husband', 'police', 'cops', 'woman', 'little girl', 'locals', 'maxi', 'hurt', 'cries', 'house', 'home', 'daughters', 'door', 'monday morning', 'firearms', 'tea stall', 'tea', 'officer', 'wits', 'knife', 'mid - day', 'several women', 'time', 'case', 'absence', 'criminal force', 'police station', 'history', 'advantage', 'indian penal code']","Vijay Nagar,  Andheri ",19.11445534,72.84826747,07:00:00,10-29-2014,Rape attempt
218,"Eleven days after she went missing, the charred remains of 23-year-old software engineer Esther Anuhya were recovered from the bushes near Tata Colony at Bhandup. The post-mortem conducted on her body at JJ Hospital revealed that the woman was raped before being murdered by the unidentified accused.


Post-mortem reports also revealed that she had been attacked with a blunt object on her head and face. Depending on the sequence of events that led to her murder, officials are suspecting the involvement of taxi or auto drivers who stationed outside Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT).


While Esther alighted from the train at platform number 3 of LTT, the CCTV cameras on the platform did not record the footage, as they weren’t working. None of the other cameras in the station caught any footage of her. Her trolley bag and laptop are still missing.

Meanwhile, cops claim that the crime was most likely not committed by an individual, but most likely involved two people, who raped and thereafter murdered her. “There are several possibilities. Sometimes in auto rickshaws and taxis, we see two people sitting in the front seat.

We will be checking the location of each rickshaw and taxi driver in the vicinity on the day the victim went missing,” said an officer. The cops also pointed out that the route from LTT to her Andheri hostel does not include Bhandup. Along with her Samsung cell phone, cops have also recovered her undergarments from the spot that were lying separated from her body.

Cops were asked as to how nobody smelt the decomposed body. “Nothing was left to decompose, as the body was burned with the help of kerosene or petrol in order to destroy the evidence. We suspect that even her denims were used to burn her body,” said an officer.

The cops have booked the unidentified accused under section 302 (for murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code. They will be adding more charges once they they a hard copy of the post-mortem report.

Esther, who was employed as a software engineer with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in Goregaon, went missing upon reaching Mumbai on January 5, a day after she left Machilipatnam, her hometown, to resume work after her Christmas vacation. On Thursday, her partly decomposed body was found by her relatives, and identified with the help of her ring.","['auto drivers', 'train', 'post - mortem report', 'taxi', 'hard copy', 'esther', 'sequence', 'january', 'disappearance', 'several possibilities', '- mortem reports', 'nothing', 'machilipatnam', 'kerosene', 'tata colony', 'people', 'head', 'blunt object', 'evidence', 'work', 'crime', 'laptop', 'christmas vacation', 'cctv', '- mortem', 'help', 'face', 'rickshaw', 'relatives', 'order', 'days', 'petrol', 'station', 'denims', 'victim', 'other cameras', 'section', 'more charges', 'goregaon', 'year', 'events', 'nobody', 'jj hospital', 'false information', 'involvement', 'tata consultancy services', 'front seat', 'offence', 'individual', 'trolley bag', 'hometown', 'samsung cell phone', 'lokmanya tilak terminus', 'bushes', 'officials', 'taxis', 'software engineer', 'screen offender', 'cops', 'woman', 'taxi driver', 'thursday', 'ltt', 'tcs', 'old software engineer esther anuhya', 'location', 'mumbai', 'body', 'auto rickshaws', 'spot', 'ring', 'day', 'remains', 'andheri hostel', 'decomposed body', 'none', 'route', 'undergarments', 'vicinity', 'platform number', 'officer', 'platform', 'murder', 'bhandup', 'footage', 'post', 'indian penal code']",Bhandup,19.1454096,72.93059778,10:00:00,05-01-2015,Burnt alive
219,"Eight months after Delhi resident was attacked at Bandra Terminus, the Mumbai Crime Branch arrested Ankur Panwar; he says he took the extreme step out of jealousy

Mumbai acid attack: Preeti Rathi's neighbour held for flinging acid at her


Mumbai Crime Branch have made an arrest in the Preeti Rathi acid attack case 45 days after the case was transferred to them. They arrested Ankur Narayanlal Panwar (23), who was Preeti’s neighbour in Bhakra Beas Management Board Colony in Narela, Delhi. According to the police, Ankur was picked up from his house.

The incident occurred on May 2 last year, when Preeti alighted from the Garib Rath Express at Bandra Terminus. A man who had covered his face with a handkerchief came forward and flung acid on her face.


The Mumbai crime branch and the Government Railway Police interrogated several people, including Preeti’s college mates, her colleagues at Batra Hospital where she studied nursing, her neighbours and relatives. However, Preeti had already named the accused as one of the suspects, but the police hadn’t interrogated him.

Jealousy behind crime
Preeti had gotten a job as a Lieutenant in Indian Navy. She came to Mumbai to join in the INHS Asvini, the naval hospital at Colaba. “Ankur’s mother used to visit Preeti’s house, as they are family friends.

As her own son was unemployed, she used to taunt him and compare him to Preeti,” said Himanshu Roy, joint commissioner of police, Crime Branch. This caused Ankur much anger. Police investigations revealed that Ankur was a hotel management graduate from a private university in Orissa and spent a huge amount on his education. Yet, he was jobless and his parents’ taunts got to him.

“Ankur’s mother came to know that the Preeti’s salary would be around Rs 50,000. She taunted him on his inability to get a job. This angered him a lot,” said Anil Dhole, assistant police inspector of Unit VII of the Mumbai Crime Branch, the team that investigated the case for 45 days. Hence, he decided to vent his fury on Preeti.

Ankur stole battery acid (sulphuric acid) from the nearby office of Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking. “His mother had told him that Preeti was taking the Garib Rath to Mumbai on May 1. He got into the train without a ticket and was searching for the right moment to throw the acid at her. As soon as Preeti got down at Bandra Terminus, he tied a handkerchief to cover his face and attacked her,” said Prafful Bhosale, assistant commissioner of police, Crime Branch.

Police claimed further investigations could throw more light on the exact reason behind Ankur’s actions. Preeti died on June 1 last year. When CCTV footage from Bandra Terminus was shown to Preeti, she had named three people who could be her potential attackers Pawan Gahlan, Ankur Panwar or Satyam Varghese.

The GRP official investigating the case arrested Gahlan, who was later released by the court. Varghese, too, was interrogated but Ankur was never questioned. Police only took statements of Ankur’s father, Narayanlal, who claimed his son was in Haridwar at the time and had gone there for an interview in a five-star hotel.

“After we took Narayanlal’s statements, we showed Ankur’s picture to Preeti’s father, Amar Singh Rathi, who told us he had not seen Ankur anywhere in the train. So we didn’t interrogate him,” said Devram Wadmare, senior police inspector of the Railway Crime Branch. Ankur had gotten a job in a five-star hotel in Ahmedabad, where a break-in occurred. The hotel asked all its employees to obtain no-objection certificates from the local police station in their native areas. Hence, Ankur returned to Delhi.

When constable Hridaynath Mishra, Subhash Mali and Nitin Palande, attached with the Unit II of the Mumbai Crime Branch saw Ankur, they questioned him. “He told them he had gone for an interview in Haridwar during the time Preeti was attacked, but when we inquired with the hotel in Haridwar, they denied that such an interview had ever taken place. This raised our suspicion. We also found some marks on his hands, which we later learnt were due to the acid,” added Bhosale.

Ankur was mostly out of Delhi for his job, so the GRP didn’t really interrogate him. This saved him for 8 months. After the investigations were handed to the Mumbai crime branch, a team of around 11 people was made under the guidance of ACP Bhosale. The team has been working in Delhi for the last 40 days and interrogated several people.

“We interrogated Preeti’s mother, her college friends, her hospital friends, her neighbours. We also took CCTV footage from various places like Delhi station. The biggest fear we had was that since eight months had passed, the clues would have been done away with. But, we managed to solve the case,” said Roy.

When they came to know about the arrest, Preeti’s family said they never suspected Ankur. “We never thought it would be Ankur. His mother used to visit our house most of the time. She also came after Preeti died,” Amar Singh Rathi, Preeti’s father told MiD DAY. “We don’t know why he was so jealous with Preeti. She was just a hard-working girl,” he lamented. Ankur has been remanded to police custody till January 23.","['nursing', 'ankur panwar', 'amar singh rathi', 'bhakra beas management board colony', 'train', 'father', 'man', 'preeti rathi', 'rs', 'ankur narayanlal panwar', 'satyam varghese', 'bandra terminus', 'incident', 'varghese', 'mother', 'grp', 'inhs asvini', 'team', 'investigations', 'january', 'june', 'preeti', 'exact reason', 'hands', 'biggest fear', 'police investigations', 'subhash mali', 'family', 'delhi resident', 'clues', 'devram wadmare', 'narayanlal', 'ankur', 'time preeti', 'assistant police inspector', 'joint commissioner', 'people', 'gahlan', 'sulphuric acid', 'potential attackers pawan gahlan', 'cctv footage', 'more light', 'break', 'suspects', 'crime', 'star hotel', 'picture', 'unit ii', 'indian navy', 'crime branch', 'anil dhole', 'hotel management graduate', 'mumbai acid attack', 'huge amount', 'ahmedabad', 'local police station', 'extreme step', 'face', 'neighbours', 'acid attack case', 'jealousy', 'lot', 'garib rath', 'relatives', 'days', 'batra hospital', 'mumbai crime branch', 'native areas', 'nearby office', 'police custody', 'college mates', 'senior police inspector', 'railway crime branch', 'place', 'actions', 'acid', 'job', 'acp bhosale', 'may', 'delhi station', 'colaba', 'garib rath express', 'naval hospital', 'police', 'neighbour', 'objection certificates', 'much anger', 'narela', 'employees', 'government railway police', 'lieutenant', 'several people', 'battery acid', 'constable hridaynath mishra', 'private university', 'education', 'girl', 'delhi', 'ticket', 'last year', 'fury', 'mumbai', 'assistant commissioner', 'colleagues', 'court', 'house', 'guidance', 'preeti ’s salary', 'taunts', 'grp official', 'mid day', 'roy', 'preeti ’s house', 'marks', 'nitin palande', 'haridwar', 'hotel', 'son', 'various places', 'suspicion', 'further investigations', 'handkerchief', 'prafful bhosale', 'arrest', 'orissa', 'hospital friends', 'interview', 'college friends', 'unit vii', 'inability', 'months', 'statements', 'own son', 'family friends', 'bhosale', 'time', 'case', 'himanshu roy', 'delhi electricity supply undertaking', 'parents', 'right moment']",Bandra,19.06691107,72.84036726,09:45:00,02-05-2014,Acid attack

256," In a dramatic incident of daylight robbery, a father-daughter duo in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad on Wednesday pulled off a theft by blindsiding staff at a jewellery store with a chilli powder attack. In a CCTV video of the incident, the man can be seen posing as a customer and talking to a staff member about what looks like a gold necklace that is kept on top of the display cabinet between them. The staff also helps him remove a gold chain he is already wearing, presumably just to try it on. All of a sudden the young woman next to the man, who was sitting still till then, throws chilli powder with both hands in the face of the staff and tries to run away. Meanwhile, the man snatches the necklace kept on the display and dashes for the exit of the shop. 
The staff immediately spring into action and grab the woman by her T-shirt collar. The man, however, successfully flees the spot with the piece of jewellery even after getting briefly caught by the hand by one of the staff members.
The incident is from Ghaziabad's Sihani Gate area.
